## How to add an article

1. You already forked this repository.
2. Navigate to `Articles` and to the relevant calendar month.
3. In the relevant month folder create a new markdown (.MD) file. 
    1. The naming convention is super important.
    2. First add the date like this: YYYY-MM-DD
    3. Then add a dash -
    4. Then add the name-of-the-article separated by dashes.
    5. Then add the file extension .MD
    6. e.g. So if I was writing an article on 03 Jan 2009 and the title was "Chancellor on brink of bailout for banks" the file should be 2009-01-03-Chancellor-on-brink-of-bailout-for-banks.MD
